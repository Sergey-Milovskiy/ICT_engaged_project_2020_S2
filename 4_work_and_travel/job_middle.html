                <h3>Work</h3>

                <h3>International students Legal work</h3>
                <p>International students in Australia on a valid student visa can work for up to 20 hours per week while school is in session, <br /> 
                    and there is no limit on the number of hours an international student can work during recognized school vacations. <br />
                    The 20-hour-per-week limit does not extend to any work the student is required to undertake as a component of his or her studies or training. <br />
                    If an international student works more than the Australian restrictions allow, his or her visa may be cancelled
                 </p>

                <h3>Get a lower pay job to gain experience</h3>
                <p>This is the best answer, because a new student must be zero experiences, <br /> 
                    the first job we might looking at labour, restaurant, and cleaning jobs. <br />
                    However, while we are improving day by day, we should able to get a proper or higher pay job with our experiences.<br />
                    Obviously, we all are hoping to get t a proper job, but it cannot happen in real life if we are not being stronger. <br />
                    In factï¼Œif we get hired in any position would be better than stay at home or run out your pocket money. </p>
